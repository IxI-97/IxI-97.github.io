    <h2 id="mofa-integration">MOFA Integration</h2>

    <h3 id="mofa-analysis">MOFA Analysis</h3>
    <p>MOFA was used according to the webpage developer indications
        (<a href="https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/">https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/</a>) with normalized input data and reduced feature size.
        The transcriptome data are normalized by the Variance Stabilising Transformation (VST) function in R
        to make the data approximately homoskedastic. The top genes with higher variance in
        normalized data are selected for the MOFA integration. The metabolomics data were transformed in
        the pipeline using a log function to improve their Gaussian distribution. All peaks are used in the
        analysis. The methylomics data didn't undergo any transformation, but like transcriptomics, only the
        top CpG islands with higher variance were selected for the integration. The top features can be selected in the advanced option parameter N° MOFA input features.
        MOFA can calculate any desired total number of factors to explain the shared variance between the -omics datasets.
        Other parameters, customizable in the interface, include Convergence mode, freqELBO, and
        maxiter. Our implementation of MOFA included an automatized optimization of the total number of
        factors. It runs the MOFA algorithm with an increasing number of factors, stopping the iteration
        when at least three models showed the last MOFA factor explaining less than 1% of the variability
        of the data. Only the top 3 models in separating our two conditions are maintained. For each
        calculated factor in each model is determined how it can discriminate statistically between the two
        groups. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test tests the factor value distribution between the two
        groups of samples correcting the p.values through the FDR method. The models selected are the
        ones with the higher number of discriminating MOFA factors, and later comparing the p.adj values.</p>

    <h2 id="mofa-factors-interpretation">MOFA Factors Interpretation</h2>

    <p>Both automatic and not automatic MOFA analysis
        includes three methods to ease the user interpretation of the discriminating MOFA factors.</p>

    <p><strong>Correlation analysis:</strong> Users can upload a matrix containing binary or numerical clinical features to
        integrate into the MOFA model. The numerical data are correlated through a Pearson correlation.
        The binary clinical data are analysed using the Wilcoxon test after dividing the groups into positive
        or negative categories. The nominal p.values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>

    <p><strong>Pathway analysis:</strong> BiomiX retrieves the top contributing genes, metabolites and CpG island for
        discriminating factors in each MOFA model. Depending on the type of omics data is selected an R
        package to highlight if there is an enrichment of some biological or metabolic pathway within the
        enriched genes, metabolites and CpG island. The genes are analysed by EnrichR using the
        "Reactome", "GO biological process" and "CODE and ChEA consensus TFs from ChIP-X"
        libraries, while the metabolites are analysed through MetPath using the KEGG and HMDB
        databases. The CpG islands are associated with their genes, if it exists and is examined through
        EnrichR.</p>

    <p><strong>Pubmed bibliography research:</strong> For each discriminating factor in each MOFA model, top contributing genes, metabolites, and CpG island genes are used for PubMed searches to gain insights into factor identities. The search algorithm operates on three levels, prioritizing abstracts that combine more multiomic contributors. At the first level, abstracts include at least one of the top ten contributors; at the second level, abstracts contain at least one contributor from any two omics (e.g., transcriptomics–metabolomics); and the third level includes abstracts with at least one contributor from a single omics.</p>
    <p>The output is a .TSV file with PubMed articles, total and individual contributor matches, DOIs, and keywords. Since author-provided keywords are limited, BiomiX performs additional text-mining with litsearchr v1.0.0, generating a vocabulary of frequent word combinations filtered against Gene Ontology and human phenotype terms. The top 15 terms are included in the .TSV file, along with a final word frequency analysis across all abstracts retrieved from each level.</p>
