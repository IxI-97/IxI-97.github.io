    <p>To provide the users with all the tools to understand each omics data and how to analyse them we wrote this detailed guide to address the users to the sources where understand the principles of each omics.</p>

    <h3 id="Transcriptomics">Transcriptomics:</h3>

    

    Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used technique to analyze the transcriptome, which represents the complete set of RNA molecules in a population of cells. It provides insights into gene expression, splicing events, and transcript abundance across different conditions or treatments. Common steps include:

  <ol>
    <li><strong>RNA Isolation:</strong> RNA is extracted from the sample, typically using methods that preserve the integrity of the RNA. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) is the value to estimate the RNA integrity. A score above 6-7, on a RIN scale from 0 to 10 is required to asses a good RNA quality.</li>
    <li><strong>cDNA Library Preparation and sequencing:</strong> The RNA is converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription. The cDNA is then fragmented, and adapters are added to facilitate sequencing. the library is sequenced on platforms such as Illumina, generating millions of short nucleotide sequences called reads. These reads represent fragments of the original RNA molecules. This video illustrates the method: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8&ab_channel=Illumina">Link</a></li>
    <li><strong>Mapping and Matrix Data Generation:</strong> The sequencing reads are mapped to a reference genome or transcriptome using specialized software like STAR, HISAT2, or Bowtie2. Mapping aligns the reads to specific regions, helping identify which genes or transcripts are expressed. Once mapped, the number of reads aligning to each gene is counted, generating a count matrix. Each row represents a gene, and each column corresponds to a sample. The count matrix is the primary data format used for downstream analysis.</li>

    </div>
    
    <li><strong>Statistical Properties of RNA-seq Data:</strong> RNA-seq count data is not normally distributed but follows discrete distributions, often resembling a negative binomial distribution due to overdispersion (variability greater than expected under a Poisson model). The data may have large dynamic ranges (from very low to very high expression, defined as <strong> “homoscedasticity” </strong> ), and sequencing depth variability ( <strong> “Size factor” </strong> ) that must be accounted for during analysis. </li>   

    -DESeq2: This R packages model RNA-seq count data using a negative binomial distribution. It performs Size factor normalization and statistical testing to account for variability in sequencing depth and dispersion. By default, in BiomiX the counts are normalized by variance stabilizing transformation (vst) to correct the homoscedasticity.
    -Limma: This package is suitable for normalized data that follow an approximately normal (Gaussian) distribution. Examples (RPKM, FPKM and TPM, vst normalized).

    <h3 id="Metabolomics">Metabolomics:</h3>

    <p>Metabolomics is the comprehensive study of metabolites—small molecules involved in metabolism—within a biological system. These metabolites reflect the biochemical activities of cells, tissues, or organisms and provide insights into their physiological and pathological states. Here is an explanation of the principles: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D77pACc0uF8&ab_channel=Chemistorian">Link</a></p>
    <p>Metabolomics typically involves the extraction of metabolites from biological samples (e.g., tissues, blood, or urine), followed by analysis using high-throughput techniques such as mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These methods measure the abundance of metabolites, enabling their identification and quantification. Common steps in this analysis include:</p
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
    <li><strong>Data generation and Peak Detection::</strong> Identifying metabolite signals in raw data.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Alignment:</strong> Aligning signals across samples to ensure consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Correcting for variations in sample processing or instrument performance. </li>
