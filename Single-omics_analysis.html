    <h3 id="General-guidelines">General guidelines</h3>
    <p>BiomiX was developed to compare two groups using single and multiple omics. To work properly, the input file must follow a specific format and criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>Metadata: </strong></p>
    <p>BiomiX requires uploading a metadata file in the BiomiX launcher. The first column must contain the sample ID, while the others contain other sample variables.</p>
    <li><strong>"ID" column (mandatory):</strong> This is the first column and contains the sample ID.</li>
    <li><strong>"CONDITION" column (mandatory):</strong> This column must contain the sample condition. These conditions will be available for selection in the main interface.</li>
    <li><strong>"SAMPLE_TYPE" column (optional):</strong> This column is designed for specific conditions. Suppose the input matrix contains samples from different tissues or cells (convoluted matrix), and this source is also defined in the sample ID (e.g., ID = 25658_BLymphocyte, 25658_GlialCells). In that case, this column allows analysis to be performed only on data from the selected tissues or cells.</li>
    <li><strong>"GENDER" column (optional): </strong> This column can be used to adjust the LIMMA or DESeq2 model for transcriptomics data.</li>
    <li><strong>"AGE" column (optional):</strong> This column can also be used to adjust the LIMMA or DESeq2 model for transcriptomics data.</li>
 
<p>Any other metadata column can be used to filter the data via the Metadata section in the advanced options or for the PCA and UMAP preview-QC visualization.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Matrix: </strong></p>

    <p>BiomiX requires an expression matrix where the columns represent the samples and the rows contain the variables.</p>
    <p><strong>Omics differences: </strong></p>
      
    <li><strong>In transcriptomics,</strong> the variables (genes) should be named using GENE SYMBOL or ENSEMBL ID.</li>
    <li><strong>In metabolomics,</strong> variables (metabolites) should be named using KEGG, HMDB, or official compound names. If the peaks are not annotated, the format should be "peak_[number]," especially for MS1 and MS2 annotation.</li>
    <li><strong>In methylomics, </strong> variables must use the EPIC or 450K array code. </li>
    <li><strong>In Undefined omics, </strong> any variable name is accepted.</li>

    
    <h3 id="transcriptomics">Transcriptomics</h3>

    <h4 id="Single-Omics-Analysis">Single Omics Analysis</h4>
    <p>The analysis identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) along with their statistics (Log2FC and adjusted p-values), and provides visualizations such as volcano plots and heatmaps. If SEX and GENDER columns are included in the metadata, they will be used to adjust the DESeq2 or Limma model. The default thresholds for DEGs are set to Log2FC > 0.5 and adjusted p-value < 0.05.</p>

    <p>Biological process enrichment is explored using the R version of EnrichR, with options to export data for external tools such as <strong>GSEA</strong> <a href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp"> Link </a> and <strong>EnrichR</strong> <a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/"> Link </a>. Within the Preview-QC visualization, users can choose to transform the data: if transformed, DGE is performed with Limma; if not, and the expression matrix contains raw counts, DESeq2 is used instead. The transformed data are then used as input for MOFA integration. To optimize analysis speed, only the most variable genes are selected (5000 by default, customizable in the MOFA section of the advanced options).</p>

        <h4>Additional Features</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Gene Panel subgrouping:</strong> It is possible to provide a panel of genes within <strong>GENE_PANEL</strong> file, in the <strong>General section of the advanced options</strong> The genes must be in Gene symbol format and tab-delimited (by enter button).
                <pre><code>GENES_FOR_SUBPOPULATION
SIGLEC1
IFIT3
IFI6
LY6E
MX1
USP18
OAS3
IFI44L
</code></pre>
               These genes will generate a heatmap displaying the expression standard deviation of each specific gene across samples. This enables classification of condition/disease samples into positive and negative groups, while BiomiX performs DGE analysis to compare the chosen controls with these two subgroups
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Clinical or Biological Marker Validation:</strong> Adding a column named <strong>MARKER</strong> in the metadata is possible to classify samples based on clinical or biological marker measurements. This marker classification can then be compared to gene panel subgrouping to observe similarities or differences.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3 id="metabolomics">Metabolomics</h3>

    <p>BiomiX metabolomics data requires peaks signals matrix <strong>Msg</strong> where the columns <strong>s</strong> represent the samples while the rows <strong>g</strong> contain the arbitrary peak numbers. BiomiX is flexible, allowing annotated and not annotated metabolomics data. If the annotation is required, based on the available information can execute an MS1 annotation (mass/charge ratio and retention time values required) or an MS2 one (fragmentation files . Mzml required).</p>

    <p>If you have only row .mzML files, to generate the peak signals matrix we strongly suggest this easy R pipeline by Á. Fernández-Ochoa (https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo10010028) or Metaboanalyst.</p>

    <p>The peak signals from the condition/treated samples are compared with the CTRL calculating the Log2FC as the log2 of the ratio between the median peak signal in condition-treated samples/ median peak signal in CTRL for each peak.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/IxI-97/IxI-97.github.io/blob/main/Metabolomics.svg?raw=true">
    </div>

    <p>The significant metabolites increased and reduced are displayed in a volcano plot while a logarithmic transformation is applied to the peak signal matrix for MOFA integration.</p>

    <p>To unveil the change in biological pathways, BiomiX automatically exploits a methPath v1.0.5 from tidymass v1.0.8 to spot enrichment in the metabolic process among the significantly changed metabolites. Moreover, for a deeper analysis, it prepares ready-to-copy files as input for Metaboanalyst. It is one of the most advanced online tools for metabolomics analysis, including enrichment and Metabolite set enrichment analysis. Autonomously, if transcriptomics results are available in BiomiX analysis will join the metabolomics and transcriptomics results into files copiable on Metaboanalyst to launch joint pathway analysis and network analysis.</p>

    <h3 id="methylomics">Methylomics</h3>

    <p>Biomix requires an expression matrix <strong>Msg</strong> where the columns <strong>s</strong> represent the samples while the rows <strong>g</strong> contain the CpG island annotation. The matrix must contain the beta-values, if not available, these can be obtained by the minfi R package. The Differential methylation analysis (DMA) is performed using the ChAMP database, providing the results of the CpG island hypermethylated and hypomethylated with a volcano plot. The threshold has been set as default to the beta value change (Δbeta) > |0.15| and p.adj < 0.05.</p>

    <p>After the file selection, it is possible to decide if the selected file must be used as input for the analysis or if you desire to modify it in the BiomiX standard format.</p>

    <p>When you select <strong>"Yes"</strong> to the Pop-up <strong>"Do you want to modify the file?"</strong>, another Pop-up will appear, asking for the file separator, the header, the column containing the ID and the type of decimal separator.</p>

    <p>Then the matrix preview will appear in the "preview" tab, allowing the user to visualize if the format is the right one. If not the case it is possible to modify the table using the other tab, which contains buttons to remove specific columns and rows and eventually transpose the matrix. <strong>WARNING:</strong> The preview will include the first 10 columns and rows, so it does not represent the entire matrix.</p>
