    <h3 id="transcriptomics">Transcriptomics</h3>

    <h4 id="input-information">Input Information</h4>
    <p>BiomiX analyses the expression matrix to quantify the expression difference between two groups of samples discriminating automatically between raw counts, analyzed using the Deseq package, and normalized counts, analyzed by Limma package. Biomix requires an expression matrix <strong>Msg</strong> where the columns <strong>s</strong> represent the samples while the rows <strong>g</strong> contain the genes in Ensembl or gene names format.</p>

    <p>BiomiX is developed to deconvolute matrices containing samples from different experiments and select only the ones the user wants to analyze. For example, analyze only B cells in a matrix containing the expression of B cells, T cells, Neutrophils, and Monocytes.</p>

    <p>The tool has been developed to accept both formats and to provide input in MOFA including only the ID number to allow integration with different omics. So if you have a convoluted matrix it is enough to run the DGE analysis, cross the selection option and use in the label the name of the tissue. BiomiX will look in the <strong>SAMPLE_TYPE</strong> column and filter on the <strong>tissue_name</strong>.</p>

    <h4 id="the-analysis">The Analysis</h4>
    <p>The analysis highlights the differentially expressed genes (DEG), their Log2FC and p.adj plus pff reports containing volcano plots, heatmaps, and gene variances. If sex and gender are available in the metadata these will be automatically used to correct the Deseq2 or Limma model. The default thresholds to consider the differentially expressed genes were set to Log2FC > 0.5 and p.adj < 0.05.</p>

    <p>The enrichment of biological processes in the results is explored in the R version of EnrichR. Moreover, pre-treated output files are produced to carry out the gene set enrichment analysis using GSEA or EnrichR. The expression matrix is also normalized by variance stabilizing transformation (vst) for data visualization and MOFA integration.</p>

        <h4>Additional Features</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Gene Panel subgrouping:</strong> It is possible to provide a panel of genes within <strong>GENE_PANEL</strong> file, in <strong>Transcriptomics/INPUT</strong> directory. The genes must be in Gene symbol format and tab-delimited (by enter button).
                <pre><code>GENES_FOR_SUBPOPULATION
SIGLEC1
IFIT3
IFI6
LY6E
MX1
USP18
OAS3
IFI44L
</code></pre>
                These genes will build a heatmap containing the expression standard deviation of each specific gene in each sample. This will allow us to classify the condition/disease samples in positive and negative while BiomiX will carry out a differential gene expression analysis comparing the chosen controls and these two groups.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Subgrouping comparison with other clinical/biological data:</strong> It is possible to add a column named <strong>MARKER</strong> in the metadata containing the classification according to clinical or biological analysis on the samples. This marker can be compared to the subgrouping obtained from the user gene panel to observe similarities or differences.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <h3 id="metabolomics">Metabolomics</h3>

    <p>BiomiX metabolomics data requires peaks signals matrix <strong>Msg</strong> where the columns <strong>s</strong> represent the samples while the rows <strong>g</strong> contain the arbitrary peak numbers. BiomiX is flexible, allowing annotated and not annotated metabolomics data. If the annotation is required, based on the available information can execute an MS1 annotation (mass/charge ratio and retention time values required) or an MS2 one (fragmentation files . Mzml required).</p>

    <p>If you have only row .mzML files, to generate the peak signals matrix we strongly suggest this easy R pipeline by Á. Fernández-Ochoa (ADD THE TUTORIAL).</p>

    <p>The peak signals from the condition/treated samples are compared with the CTRL calculating the Log2FC as the log2 of the ratio between the median peak signal in condition-treated samples/ median peak signal in CTRL for each peak.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/IxI-97/IxI-97.github.io/blob/main/Metabolomics.svg?raw=true">
    </div>

    <p>The significant metabolites increased and reduced are displayed in a volcano plot while a logarithmic transformation is applied to the peak signal matrix for MOFA integration.</p>

    <p>To unveil the change in biological pathways, BiomiX automatically exploits a methPath v1.0.5 from tidymass v1.0.8 to spot enrichment in the metabolic process among the significantly changed metabolites. Moreover, for a deeper analysis, it prepares ready-to-copy files as input for Metaboanalyst32. It is one of the most advanced online tools for metabolomics analysis, including enrichment and Metabolite set enrichment analysis. Autonomously, if transcriptomics results are available in BiomiX analysis will join the metabolomics and transcriptomics results into files copiable on Metaboanalyst to launch joint pathway analysis and network analysis.</p>

    <h3 id="methylomics">Methylomics</h3>

    <p>Biomix requires an expression matrix <strong>Msg</strong> where the columns <strong>s</strong> represent the samples while the rows <strong>g</strong> contain the CpG island annotation. The matrix must contain the beta-values, if not available, these can be obtained by the minfi R package33. The Differential methylation analysis (DMA) is performed using the ChAMP database, providing the results of the CpG island hypermethylated and hypomethylated with a volcano plot. The threshold has been set as default to the beta value change (Δbeta) > |0.15| and p.adj < 0.05.</p>

    <h3 id="interface-usage">Interface Usage</h3>
    
    <h4 id="assisted-input-modification">Assisted Input Modification</h4>
    
    <p>Click on the input button and select the file you want to modify.</p>

    <div align="center">

    </div>

    <p>After the file selection, it is possible to decide if the selected file must be used as input for the analysis or if you desire to modify it in the BiomiX standard format.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/IxI-97/IxI-97.github.io/blob/main/INPUT_3.png?raw=true">
    </div>

    <p>When you select "Yes" to the Pop-up "Do you want to modify the file?", another Pop-up will appear, asking for the file separator, the header, the column containing the ID and the type of decimal separator.</p>

    <div align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/IxI-97/IxI-97.github.io/blob/main/INPUT_4.png?raw=true">
    </div>

    <p>Then the matrix preview will appear in the "preview" tab, allowing the user to visualize if the format is the right one. If not the case it is possible to modify the table using the other tab, which contains buttons to remove specific columns and rows and eventually transpose the matrix. WARNING: The preview will include the first 10 columns and rows, so it does not represent the entire matrix.</p>
